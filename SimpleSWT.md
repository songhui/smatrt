This is a small case, with trivial but interesting features. We defined and wrapped the management capabilities of SWT, like getting texts, changing colors, etc. The detailed introduction and effects could be found in our [tutorial](http://smatrt.googlecode.com/files/tutorial%20-%20smart.pdf), and the specifications and generated code can be found downloaded [here](http://code.google.com/p/smatrt/source/browse/#svn/trunk/cases/SimpleSWT).

Here is snapshot, you can edit the above model, and the windows at the bottom (an SWT view) will be changed. Enjoy it!
